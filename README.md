# What is Swagger?
Swagger is a tool that acts like a helpful guide for developers in the realm of web development. It's akin to a well-organized manual that explains how to use web APIs in a clear and understandable manner. This tool ensures that developers and users can easily comprehend the ins and outs of an APIâ€”what data to send, where to send it, and what to expect in return. In simpler terms, Swagger streamlines the process of creating comprehensive API documentation, making it akin to a user-friendly map for navigating the landscape of web development.

# Advantages of Integrating Swagger with Laravel
Integrating Swagger with Laravel offers several advantages, enhancing the development and documentation process of web APIs. Here are some key benefits:

**1. Clear API Documentation:**

Swagger provides a standardized and visually appealing way to document APIs. Integration with Laravel ensures that your API documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand for both developers and API consumers.

**2. Interactive API Exploration:**

Swagger generates an interactive API explorer, allowing developers to interact with and test API endpoints directly from the documentation. This feature simplifies the debugging process and accelerates API development.

**3. Automatic Documentation Updates:**

With Laravel and Swagger integration, your API documentation is automatically updated as you modify your code. This reduces the likelihood of documentation becoming outdated, ensuring that developers always have accurate information.

**4. Consistent API Design:**

Swagger enforces consistency in API design by providing a standardized format for documenting endpoints, request parameters, and responses. This consistency is beneficial for maintaining a cohesive and well-structured API.

**5. Client Code Generation:**

Swagger supports the generation of client code in various programming languages based on the API documentation. This feature streamlines the development process for API consumers, as they can generate code snippets tailored to their preferred language.

**6. Improved Collaboration:**

Integration with Swagger enhances collaboration between development teams and stakeholders. Clear and updated documentation facilitates communication by providing a shared understanding of the API's functionality and usage.

**7. Testing and Validation:**

Swagger allows developers to define and validate API request and response formats. This ensures that data is correctly formatted and reduces the likelihood of errors in API interactions.

**8. Enhanced Security:**

Swagger documentation can include information about authentication and authorization mechanisms. This helps developers and security professionals understand and implement the necessary security measures for the API.

**9. Standardized OpenAPI Specification:**

Swagger follows the OpenAPI Specification, a widely adopted industry standard for API documentation. This standardization promotes interoperability and allows for the integration of various tools and libraries that support the OpenAPI Specification.

**10. Time and Resource Efficiency:**

Laravel Swagger integration reduces the time and resources required for manually creating and updating API documentation. This automation allows developers to focus more on coding and less on documentation maintenance.


# Requirements and Setup for Laravel Swagger

***Requirements for Laravel Swagger Integration:***
 - [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/)
 - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
 - Swagger/OpenAPI Specification
 - Swagger UI Package (If not using Laravel Sanctum)
 - Text Editor or IDE([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Atom Editor](https://atom.en.lo4d.com/windows) etc.)
 - [XAMPP Tool](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

***Developer Should Know to Start Integrations***
 - Laravel Basics
 - API Concepts
 - Basic Composer Commands
 - Swagger/OpenAPI Understanding
 - Middleware in Laravel
 - Command Line Proficiency
 - Working with Laravel and Database


# Step-by-Step Guide for Laravel Swagger Integration.
Integrating Swagger with Laravel involves a few steps to generate API documentation for your Laravel application. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Install Laravel Project
```
composer global require laravel/installer

laravel new laravel-swagger-api-docs

or

composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-swagger-api-docs

```

After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:

```
cd laravel-swagger-api-docs
 
php artisan serve

```

### 2. Database Configuration in laravel

Open the .env file in the root of your Laravel project. This file contains environment-specific configuration, including database settings. Set the following parameters:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=your_database_port
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```
***Example:***
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=example_l_swagger
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=1234

```

To create a database for a Laravel project, you'll need a database management system (DBMS) and a local development environment. Laravel supports various database systems, but MySQL is commonly used. So Install XAMPP or any DBMS.


### 3. Install Laravel Passport and Configuration

Laravel Passport, which is a Laravel package for API authentication using OAuth2. The below command will download and install the Passport package and its dependencies.

```
composer require laravel/passport

php artisan passport:install
```
After install Update */config/database.php* file below 2 lines.

```
'mysql' => [
    'charset' => 'utf8', // default value is 'utf8mb4'utf8mb4
    'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci', // default value is 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'
]

```

***php artisan migrate*** is a Laravel command that applies pending database migrations, creating or updating database tables based on defined schema changes in your application. Here, we are using the default migration file and its related table.

```
php artisan migrate
```

Open your App\User model and make sure it implements the Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens trait. In *\app\Models\User.php* use **Passport** instend of **Sanctum** for HasApiTokens.

```
use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable;
}
```

Update *config/auth.php*

```
'guards' => [
        'web' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'passport',
            'provider' => 'users',
            'hash' => false,
        ],
    ],
```

### 4. Install Swagger Required Packages and it's Configuration

Install the necessary packages for Swagger integration:

```
composer require "darkaonline/l5-swagger"
```

Publish the configuration file to customize Swagger settings:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider "L5Swagger\L5SwaggerServiceProvider"
```

This will create a *config/l5-swagger.php* file.

Configure *l5-swagger.php*. Open the generated */config/l5-swagger.php* file and uncomment the below line of code.

```
/* Open API 3.0 support */
'passport' => [ // Unique name of security
    'type' => 'oauth2', // The type of the security scheme. Valid values are "basic", "apiKey" or "oauth2".
    'description' => 'Laravel passport oauth2 security.',
    'in' => 'header',
    'scheme' => 'https',
    'flows' => [
        "password" => [
            "authorizationUrl" => config('app.url') . '/oauth/authorize',
            "tokenUrl" => config('app.url') . '/oauth/token',
            "refreshUrl" => config('app.url') . '/token/refresh',
            "scopes" => []
        ],
    ],
],

```

### 5. Create Routes

```
use App\Http\Controllers\Api\AuthController;

Route::post('login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
Route::post('register', [AuthController::class, 'register']);
```

### 6. Create User Registration and Login Controller

```
php artisan make:controller Api/AuthController
```

### 7. Implement User Registration and Login Logic.

```
<?php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers\Api;

    use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    use Hash;
    use App\Models\User;
